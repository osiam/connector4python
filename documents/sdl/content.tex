\section{Introduction}

The audience of this document are members of the OSIAM-NG Team.
The purporse of this Document is to describe a process to enhance the quality of
OSIAM-NG from the perspective of security in iterative steps.

\section{Process}
This chapter describes the SDL process which will fit into the short iterations of an agile development. It is splitted in three categories defined by frequency of completion.

The first category consists of the SDL requirements that are essential to security \footnote{\url{http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-10/Sullivan_Bryan/BlackHat-DC-2010-Sullivan-SDL-Agile-wp.pdf}} \footnote{\url{http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl/discover/sdlagile.aspx}}

1. Every-Sprint practices
	- Run static code analysis tools per build
	- Define a list of approved tools and associated security checks
	- Threat model all new features, determine risks from those threats, and establish appropriate countermeasures 
	- Secure coding: cross-site scripting, interpreter injections(SQL, LDAP, JSON injections and so on), use only strong crypto, use filtering and escaping
	- Secure design: attack surface reduction, principle of least privilege (a user should have only as many rights as it needs to do its job), secure defaults	
	- Security Review includes an examination of threat models, tools outputs, and performance against the quality gates and bug bars. It results in one of three different outcomes: Passed , Passed with exceptions, failed


The second category of SDL requirements consists of tasks that must be performed on a regular basis over the lifetime of the project but that are not so critical as to be mandated for each sprint.
Instead of completing all bucket requirements each sprint, product teams must complete only one SDL requirement from each bucket of related tasks during each sprint.
2. Bucket Requirements
	- Verification Tasks: Attack surface review, Negative Testing
	- Design Review: Review crypto design, User Account Control
	- Define/update Quality Gates/Bug Bar (A Bug Bar is a list of security vulnerabilities with then according severity: for example there can be a constraint that there will be no release if there are known vulnerabilities in the application with a ``critical'' or ``important'' rating)
	- Deal with third-party software

The third category of SDL requirements consists of tasks that need to be met when you first start a new project or when you first start using SDL with an existing project. These are generally once-per-project tasks that won’t need to be repeated after they’re complete.
3. One-Time Requirements
	- Security and privacy analysis includes assigning security experts
	- Defining minimum security and privacy criteria for the application
	- Deploying a security vulnerability item tracking system which allowing for creation, tracking and reporting of software vulnerabilities
	- Identify functional aspects of the software that require closer review

\section{Threat Model}
Will be a Picture.

\section{List of possible Target}
In OSIAM-NG are several possible targets for an attacker:
\begin{itemize}
\item REST-APIs -- an attacker can use our REST-API to gain informationen about or overload the system or application.
\item Running Container -- an attacker can use informations about the running container (e.q. Tomcat) to start a specific attack.
\item Data Base -- an attacker could obtain access to the used database and gain sensible data.
\item Running System -- an attacker could try to attack the system directly to gain access.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{API Calls}

\section{Type of Attacks}
SQL Injection, Java-Script injection via User-Input.
Guessing of IDs via error messages, DDoS, 
attacks to guess a password by measuring response time
\subsection{Destroy the System}
SQL Injection, DDoS, ...

\subsection{Leak Informations}
SQL Injection, Java-Script injection, Guessing of IDs via Error-Messages, 
attacks to guess the password by time measuring, attack the DataBase to retrieve Informations

\subsection{Corrupt the User-Agent}
Java-Script injection, XSS,...

\section{Possible Counter Actions}

\subsection{Process}
Security-Audits, regular Pen-Testing
